WRITE YOUR STYLES IN A .CSS FILE AND THEN INCLUDE IT USING A
<!--<link>--> in the head of the html document.

<!-- DON NOT USE THE <style></style> --> TAG IN THE HEAD TAG OR INSIDE THE INPUT TAG



* COLOR

<!-- The color CSS property sets the foreground color value of an element's text and text decorations, and sets 
the <currentcolor> value. current color may be used as an indirect value on other properties and is the default for other color properties, such as border-color. -->


* BACKGROUND COLOR

The background-color CSS property sets the background color of an element.

BACKGROUND-COLOR AND BACKGROUND ARE BOTH DIFFERENT ELEMENTS



* RGB

RED,GREEN,BLUE CHANNEL

EACH CHANNEL RANGES FROM 0-255

EXAMPLE

h2{
color: teal;
background-color:rgb(89,151,0);
}



* HEXADECIMAL


h2{
color: #1AEAE0;
background-color:rgb(89,151,0);
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*CSS TEXT PROPERTIES

TEXT ALIGN

The text-align CSS property sets the horizontal alignment of the content inside a block element or
table-cell box. This means it works like vertical-align but in the horizontal direction.

h1{
text-align: center;
}


* FONT WEIGHT https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight

The font-weight CSS property sets the weight (or boldness) of the font. The weights available depend on the font-family
that is currently set.

h1{
text-align: center;
font-weight: 400;
}


* TEXT DECORATION https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-decoration

The text-decoration shorthand CSS property sets the appearance of decorative lines on text. It is a shorthand for
text-decoration-line, text-decoration-color, text-decoration-style, and the newer text-decoration-thickness property.

h1{
text-align: center;
font-weight: 400;
text-decoration: blue underline wavy;

}


To remove underline from hyperlinks

a{
text-decoration: none;
}



* LINE HEIGHT

The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between
lines of text. On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element.
On non-replaced inline elements, it specifies the height that is used to calculate line box height.

p {
line-height: 2;
}


* Letter Spacing

The letter-spacing CSS property sets the horizontal spacing behavior between text characters.
This value is added to the natural spacing between characters while rendering the text. Positive
values of letter-spacing causes characters to spread farther apart, while negative values of
letter-spacing bring characters closer together.


h1{
text-align: center;
font-weight: 400;
text-decoration: blue underline wavy;
letter-spacing: 15px;
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* FONT SIZE https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/FONT-SIZE

The font-size CSS property sets the size of the font. Changing the font size also updates
<!-- the sizes of the font size-relative <length> units, such as em, ex, and so forth. -->

h1{
text-align: center;
font-weight: 400;
text-decoration: blue underline wavy;
letter-spacing: 15px;
font-size: 80px;
}


* FONT FAMILY https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/FONT-family

The font-family CSS property specifies a prioritized list of one or more font family names
and/or generic family names for the selected element.

Values are separated by commas to indicate that they are alternatives. The browser will select the first font in the
list that is
installed or that can be downloaded using a @font-face at-rule.

It is often convenient to use the shorthand property font to set font-size and other font related properties all at
once.

You should always include at least one generic family name in a font-family list, since there's no guarantee that any
given font is
available. This lets the browser select an acceptable fallback font when necessary.

The font-family property specifies a list of fonts, from highest priority to lowest. Font selection does not stop at the
first
font in the list that is on the user's system. Rather, font selection is done one character at a time, so that if an
available
font does not have a glyph for a needed character, the latter fonts are tried. When a font is only available in some
styles,
variants, or sizes, those properties may also influence which font family is chosen.


EXAMPLE

h1{
text-align: center;
font-weight: 400;
text-decoration: blue underline wavy;
letter-spacing: 15px;
font-size: 80px;
font-family: Arial;
}

IF FONT NOT AVAILABLE IN MACHINE CAN USE A BACK UP FONT LIKE THIS

h1{
text-align: center;
font-weight: 400;
text-decoration: blue underline wavy;
letter-spacing: 15px;
font-size: 80px;
font-family: Segoe UI,Arial,sans-serif;
}


Telling machine to pick any font of sans-serif FAMILY

text-align: center;
font-weight: 400;
text-decoration: blue underline wavy;
letter-spacing: 15px;
font-size: 80px;
font-family: Segoe UI,Arial,sans-serif;


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* CSS SELECTORS

CSS Rules: Everything you do in CSS follows basic pattern below

selector{
property:value
}


(1) Universal Selector---> 'Selects Everything'

*{
background-color: cyan;
}

(2) Element Selector ----> 'Selects eveything of a given type'

button{
font-size: 30px;
}


WE CAN USE COMMA TO COMBINE MULTIPLE SELECTORS IN A LIST

h1,h2 {
color: darkslateblue;
}



*ID SELECTOR

DON'T SPAM ID'S

WE CAN USE IDS ON ANY ELEMENT TO PROVIDE A HOOK FOR CSS TO SINGLE OUT A SINGLE ELEMENT
TO STYLE ONE THING DIFFERENTLY

ID IS UNIQUE AND ONLY ONE THING SHOULD BE GIVEN A SINGLE ID

SYNTAX IS

# NAME OF THE ID GIVEN TO THE ELEMENT IN HTML, IN THIS CASE THE BUTTON ELEMENT

IN .html file
<!-- <button id="signup">Sign Up</button> -->


IN .css file
#signup{
background-color: #003049;
}



* CLASS SELECTOR

Select elements with class of 'complete'

CLASS CAN BE GIVEN TO ANY ELEMENT, IT'S LIKE A LABEL.

Class is similar to id's

Class can be applied to multiple elements

SYNTAX

.name of the class{
color:green;
}


IN .html
<!-- <h2>Lol look at this hilarious meme <span class="tag">funny</span></h2> -->

IN .css

.tag{
background-color: #d00000;
color: #f8edeb;
font-size: 16px;
}



* DECENDANT SELECTOR

SYNTAX

Select all anchor tags nested inside list

li a{
color:teal;
}


IN .html FILE

<!-- <section class="post">
<span>Posted by <a href="#213adas">/u/not_funny</a></span> -->


IN .css FILE

.post a{
color: #003049;
}



* ADJACENT SELECTOR


SELECT ONLY PARAGRAPHS THAR ARE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED BY H1

h1+p {
color:red;
}


IN .html file

<!-- <input type="text" placeholder="search" id="search"> -->
<!-- <button>Log In</button> -->


<!-- <h2>Lol look at this hilarious meme <span class="tag">funny</span></h2> -->
<!-- <button>+Vote</button> -->

IN .css file

input + button{
background-color: teal;
}


h2+button{
font-size:20px;
}



* DIRECT DISCENDANT SELECTOR

<!-- SELECT ONLLY THE <li>'s' that are a direct decendant of <div> element -->

div > li{
color:white;
}



IN .css file

footer > a{
color:teal;
}

IN .html FILE

<!-- <footer>
    <a href="hhfhf">Content available under license</a>
</footer> -->




* ATTRIBUTE SELECTOR NOT USED THAT MUCH

Select all input elements where the type attribute is set to text

input[type="text"]{
width:300px;
color:yellow;
}


IN .css FILE

input[type="password"]{
color:yellow;
}

IN .html FILE

<!-- <input type="password" placeholder="password"> -->



* PSEUDO CLASSES

keywords addes to a selector that specifies a special state of the
selected element(s)

:active
:checked
:first
:first-child
:hover
:not()
:nth-child()
:nth-of-type()


(1) :hover

The :hover CSS pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a
pointing device, but does not necessarily activate it. It is generally triggered when
the user hovers over an element with the cursor (mouse pointer).

Styles defined by the :hover pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related
pseudo-class (:link, :visited, or :active) that has at least equal specificity. To style links
appropriately, put the :hover rule after the :link and :visited rules but before the :active one,
as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover — :active.


IN .CSS file

.post button:hover{
background-color: red;
color: white;
}


.post a{
color: #003049;
font-weight: 700;
text-decoration: none; ---> no underline initially
}

.post a:hover {
text-decoration: underline; ---> underline when you hover
}



(2) :active

The :active CSS pseudo-class represents an element (such as a button) that is being activated
by the user. When using a mouse, "activation" typically starts when the user presses down the primary mouse button.

<!-- The :active pseudo-class is commonly used on <a> and <button> elements. Other common targets of this pseudo-class
include elements that contain an activated element, and form elements that are being activated through their
associated <label>. -->


Styles defined by the :active pseudo-class will be overridden by any subsequent link-related pseudo-class
(:link, :hover, or :visited) that has at least equal specificity. To style links appropriately, put the
:active rule after all other link-related rules, as defined by the LVHA-order: :link — :visited — :hover —
:active.


IN .CSS file

.post button:active{
background-color: #6930c3;
}



(3) :checked

<!-- The :checked CSS pseudo-class selector represents any radio 
(<input type="radio">), checkbox (<input type="checkbox">), or option 
(<option> in a <select>) element that is checked or toggled to an on state. -->


(4) ::nth-of-type()

The :nth-of-type() CSS pseudo-class matches elements of a given type (tag name), based on their position among a group
of siblings.


IN .CSS file

.post:nth-of-type(3n){
background-color: #ffc6ff;
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



* PSEUDO ELEMENTS

Keyword added to a selector that lets you style a particular part of
selected element(s)

::after
::before
::first-letter
::selection



(1) ::first-letter

The ::first-letter CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the first letter of the first
line of a block-level element, but only when not preceded by other content (such as images or inline tables).

In .css FILE

h2::first-letter{
font-size: 50px;
}



(2) ::selection

The ::selection CSS pseudo-element applies styles to the part of a document that has been
highlighted by the user (such as clicking and dragging the mouse across text).

p::selection{
background-color: #ffba08;
}


(3) ::before

In CSS, ::before creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element.
It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.

HTML

<!-- <q>Some quotes</q>, he said, <q>are better than none.</q> -->


CSS

q::before {
content: "«";
color: blue;
}


(4) ::after

In CSS, ::after creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element.
It is often used to add cosmetic content to an element with the content property. It is inline by default.


HTML

<!-- <p class="boring-text">Here is some plain old boring text.</p>
<p>Here is some normal text that is neither boring nor exciting.</p>
<p class="exciting-text">Contributing to MDN is easy and fun.</p> -->


CSS

<!-- .exciting-text::after {
content: " <- EXCITING!"; color: green; } .boring-text::after { content: " <- BORING" ; color: red; } -->

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*SPECIFICITY

SPECIFICITY IS HOW BROWSER DECIDES WHICH RULES TO APPLY WHEN MULTIPLE RULES COULD APPLY TO SAME ELEMENT IT IS A
MEASURE OF HOW SPECIFIC A GIVEN SELECTOR IS. THE MORE SPECIFIC SELECTOR WINS

ID ARRTIBUTE IS MORE SPECIFIC THAN CLASS ATTRIBUTE

CLASS ATTRIBUTE IS MORE SPECTIC THAN JUST THE NORMAL ELEMENT

ID>CLASS>ELEMENT



Priority Selector:


Priority 1 --> ID SELECTORS

Priority 2 --> CLASSES,ATTRIBUTES,PSEUDO CLASS SELECTOR

Priority 3 --> ELEMENT AND PSEUDO ELEMENT SELECTOR







* BOX MODEL WIDTH AND HEIGHT

Everything in CSS IS A BOX


WIDTH

The width CSS property sets an element's width. By default, it sets the width of the
content area, but if box-sizing is set to border-box, it sets the width of the border area.


IN .CSS file

div{
width: 200px;
}


HEIGHT

The height CSS property specifies the height of an element. By default, the property defines the
height of the content area. If box-sizing is set to border-box, however, it instead determines the
height of the border area.

The min-height and max-height properties override height.


IN .CSS file

div{
width: 200px;
height: 200px;
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*BORDER AND BORDER RADIUS

IS IS THE BORDER AROUND ELEMENT


BORDER WIDTH*

CONTROLS THE THICKNESS OF THE BORDER


BORDER COLOR*

CONTROLS THE COLOR OF THE BORDER


BORDER STYLE*

CONTROLS LINE STYLE,DASHED,SOLID LINE ETC


BOX-SIZING*

The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.

IN .CSS file

#one{
background-color:#e5989b ;
border-width: 5px;
border-color: black;
border-style: solid;
/* box-sizing: border-box; */
}


#two{
background-color: #b5838b ;
border-color: #fec5bb;
border-width: 3px;
border-style: dashed;
border-left-width: 8px;
}



BORDER*

The border shorthand CSS property sets an element's border. It sets the values of border-width, border-style, and
border-color.

#three{
background-color:#6d6875 ;
border: 4px dashed black;
border-left-style: dotted;
}


BORDER RADIUS*

The border-radius CSS property rounds the corners of an element's outer border edge.
You can set a single radius to make circular corners, or two radii to make elliptical corners.



BOX MODEL PADDING*

WHEN YOU INSPECT A CERTAIN ELEMENT IN A DEV TOOL AND SEE A GREEN COLOR SURROUNDING THAT'S PADDING
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The padding CSS shorthand property sets the padding area on all four sides of an element at once.

PADDING IS THE SPACE BETWEEN THE CONTENT BOX AND THE BORDER


IN .CSS file

h1{
background-color: pink;
width: 100px;
padding-left: 100px;
padding-top: 50px;
}



BOX MODEL MARGIN*

WHEN YOU INSPECT A CERTAIN ELEMENT IN A DEV TOOL AND SEE A YELLOW COLOR SURROUNDING THAT'S MARGIN
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

The margin CSS shorthand property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element.

h1{
background-color: pink;
width: 100px;
padding-left: 100px;
padding-top: 50px;
margin: 0;
}



DISPLAY PROPERTY*


INLINE ELEMENT: WIDTH,HEIGHT ARE IGNORED. MARGIN AND PASSING PUSH ELEMENTS AWAY HORIZONTALLY BUT NOT VERTICALLY !!!!

BLOCK ELEMENT: BLOCK ELEMENTS BREAK THE FLOW OF A DOCUMENT WIDTH,HEIGHT,MARGIN AND PADDING ARE RESPECTED !!!!!

INLINE-BLOCK: BEHAVED LIKE AN INFINITE ELEMENT, EXCECT WIDTH,HEIGHT,PADDING AND MARGIN ARE RESPECTED !!!!!



The display CSS property sets whether an element is treated as a block or inline element and the layout used for its
children, such as flow layout, grid or flex.

Formally, the display property sets an element's inner and outer display types. The outer type sets an element's
participation
in flow layout; the inner type sets the layout of children. Some values of display are fully defined in their own
individual
specifications; for example the detail of what happens when display: flex is declared is defined in the CSS Flexible Box
Model
specification. See the table at the end of this document for all of the individual specifications.


IN .CSS file

h1{
background-color: palegoldenrod;
border: 1px solid black;
display: inline;
}

div {
height: 200px;
width: 200px;
background-color: olivedrab;
border: 5px solid black;
display: inline-block;
margin: 50px;
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



*CSS UNITS


(1) PERCENTAGE*

PERCENTAGE ARE ALWAYS RELATIVE TO SOME OTHER VALUE.SOMETIMES ITS A VALUE FROM A PARENT AND OTHER TIMES ITS A VALUE FROM
THE ELEMENT ITSELF


eg:
width:50% - half the width of the parent

line-height:50%- half the font size of element itself


IN .HTML FILE

<section>
    <div>

    </div>
</section>


IN .CSS FILE


section{
background-color: #6b705c;
width: 800px;
height: 800px;
}

div{
background-color: #f72585;
width: 50%;
height: 50%;
}


h1{
font-size: 40px;
border:1px solid black;
line-height: 200%;
}

HERE THE SECTION IS THE PARENT OF DIV ELEMENT AND SO USING THE PERCENTAGE
UNIT FOR DIV SIZE



(2) EM*

EM'S ARE RELATIVE UNITS

WITH FONT-SIZE 1 em EQUALS THE FONT-SIZE OF THE PARENT
2 em's TWICE THE FONT SIZE OF THE PARENT ETC

WITH OTHER PROPERTIES 1em is EQUAL TO THE COMPUTED FONT-SIZE OF THE
ELEMENT ITSELF


EVEN IF THE SIZE OF THE PARENT ELEMENT CHANGES, SIZE OF THE CHILD ELEMENTS
CHANGES ACCORDING TO THE PARENT SIZE

IN .HTML FILE

<!-- <article>
<h2>I AM H2</h2> -->


IN .CSS FILE

article{ --> ARTICLE IS THE PARENT OF H2
font-size: 30px;
}


h2{
font: size 2em;
}

SHORT COMINGS OF EM'S IS THAT THEY CAN GROW OR STACK IF IMPLEMENTED IN A LIST.
IF LIST HAS NESTED ELEMENTS THAN THE ELEMENT NESTED FURTHER DOWN THE LIST WILL SEE
IT'S SIZE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE DEPENDING ON THE PARENT ELEMENT !!!!!!!!!



(3) REM'S

ROOT EMS

THE ROOT ELEMENT IS html tag <html lang="en">

</html>

RELATIVE TO THE ROOT HTML ELEMENTS FONT-SIZE, OFTEN EASIER TO WORK WITH.

IF THE ROOT FONT SIZE IS 20PX, 1rem is always 20px, 2rem is always 40px etc.


IN .CSS FILE

#rems h2{
font-size: 3rem;
}

#rems h3 {
font-size: 2rem;
}

#rems ul{
font-size: 1rem;
}


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPACITY AND ALPHA CHANNEL*


RGBA(0 209 112 0.5)

RED --> 0
GREEN --> 209
BLUE --> 112
ALPHA--> 0.5

ALPHA GOVERNS THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE COLOR, VALUE IS FROM 0 TO 1


IN .CSS FILE

#rgba {
width: 50%;
height: 50%;
background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.7);
}



OPACITY*

The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element.
Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is
hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.


OPACITY GOVERNS ELEMENTS TARNSPARENCY INCLUDING ITS DECENDANTS


IN .CSS FILE

#opacity{
width: 50%;
height: 50%;
background-color:yellow;
opacity: 0.5;
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*POSITION PROPERTY https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position


The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.
The top, right, bottom, and left properties determine the final location of
positioned elements.


Values*


(1) STATIC

The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect.
This is the default value.

IN .CSS FILE

#static #middle {
position: static;
top: 100px;
}

IN .HTML FILE

<section id="static">
    <h2>Static</h2>
    <div></div>
    <div id="middle"></div>
    <div></div>
</section>


(2) RELATIVE

The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and then
offset relative to itself based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The
offset does not affect the position of any other elements; thus, the space given for
the element in the page layout is the same as if position were static.

This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is not auto.
Its effect on table-*-group, table-row, table-column, table-cell, and table-caption
elements is undefined.


IN .CSS FILE

#relative #middle{
position: relative;
top: 100px;
left: 100px;
}


(3) ABSOLUTE


The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is
created for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to
its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative
to the initial containing block. Its final position is determined by the
values of top, right, bottom, and left.

This value creates a new stacking context when the value of z-index is
not auto. The margins of absolutely positioned boxes do not collapse with other margins.


IN .HTML FILE

<section id="absolute">
    <h2>absolute</h2>
    <div></div>
    <div id="middle"></div>
    <div></div>
</section>


IN .CSS FILE

#absolute #middle{
position: absolute;
top: 50px;
}


THE MIDDLE BLOCK WILL MOVE 50 PX TO THE TOP RELATIVE TO THE PARENT IN THIS CASE IS "ABSOLUTE"



(4) FIXED

The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created
for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial
containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors
has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than
none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the
containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with perspective
and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final position is
determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.

This value always creates a new stacking context. In printed documents, the element
is placed in the same position on every page.


THE ELEMENT WILL STAY FIXED AT THE TOP EVEN IF YOU SCROLL DOWN THAT ELEMENT WILL ALWAYS APPEAR ON
THE TOP

#fixed #middle{
position: fixed;
top: 0px;
left: 0px;
}

<section id="fixed">
    <h2>fixed</h2>
    <div></div>
    <div id="middle"></div>
    <div></div>
</section>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* CSS TRANSITIONS

WE CAN SPECIFY PROPERTY NAME,DURATION,TIMING FUNCTION,DELAY


IN .HTML FILE (Constant div element remains only in CSS file change happens)

<div class="circle"></div>


IN .CSS FILE

.circle{
width: 300px;
height: 300px;
background-color: magenta;
transition: 3s;
}

.circle:hover{
background-color: cyan;
border-radius: 50%;
}


(1) PROPERTY NAME TRANSITIONS*


IN .CSS FILE

.circle{
width: 300px;
height: 300px;
background-color: magenta;
transition: background-color 3s;
}

.circle:hover{
background-color: cyan;
border-radius: 50%;
}

(2) DELAY*

WE CAN DELAY THE TARNSITION

IN .CSS FILE

.circle{
width: 300px;
height: 300px;
background-color: magenta;
transition: background-color 3s 1s;
}


INSTEAD OF BACKCGROUND-COLOR, WE CAN ALSO TYPE "all"


.circle:hover{
background-color: cyan;
border-radius: 50%;
}


(3) TIMING FUNCTION* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transition-timing-function

The transition-timing-function CSS property sets how intermediate values are calculated for
CSS properties being affected by a transition effect.


IN .CSS FILE

div:nth-of-type(1){
transition-timing-function: ease-in;
}

div:nth-of-type(2){
transition-timing-function: ease-out;
}

div:nth-of-type(3){
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.7,0,0.84,0);
}

div:nth-of-type(4){
transition-timing-function: cubic-bezier(0.85,0,0.15,1);
}



* CSS TRANSFORM


MARGIN: AUTO TO CENTRE THE BLOCK


(1) ROTATE*

The rotate CSS property allows you to specify rotation transforms
individually and independently of the transform property. This maps
better to typical user interface usage, and saves having to remember
the exact order of transform functions to specify in the transform property.


TRANSFORM ORIGIN**-->The transform-origin CSS property sets the origin for an element's
transformations.


(2) SCALE*

The scale() CSS function defines a transformation that resizes an element on the 2D plane. Because the amount of scaling
is defined by a vector, it can resize the horizontal and vertical dimensions at different scales. Its result is a
<!-- <transform-function> data type. -->

IN .CSS FILE

section:first-of-type h1:nth-of-type(2){
transform:scale(0.5);
}



(3)TRANSLATE*

The translate() CSS function repositions an element in the horizontal
<!-- and/or vertical directions. Its result is a <transform-function> data type. -->

IN .CSS FILE

section:first-of-type h1:nth-of-type(3){
transform:translateX(200px);
}

section:first-of-type h1:nth-of-type(4){
transform:translate(-200px,50px);
}


(4) *SKEW

The skew() CSS function defines a transformation that skews an element on the 2D plane.
<!-- Its result is a <transform-function> data type. -->

section:nth-of-type(2) h1:nth-of-type(1){
transform: skew(10deg);
}



*BOX SHADOW https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/box-shadow

The box-shadow CSS property adds shadow effects around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects separated by
commas. A box shadow is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.

The box-shadow property enables you to cast a drop shadow from the frame of almost any element. If a border-radius
is specified on the element with a box shadow, the box shadow takes on the same rounded corners. The z-ordering of
multiple box shadows is the same as multiple text shadows (the first specified shadow is on top).



* VIEWPORT WIDTH(vw) & VIEWPORT HEIGHT(vh)

VIEWPORT WIDTH AND VIEWPORT HEIGHT ARE KIND OF LIKE PERCENTAGE UNIT

HOWEVER UNLIKE PERCENTAGE WHO DEPEND ON THEIR PARENTS SIZE,"vh" and "vw" depend on the screen size.

For example,

50vh means that element will have 50 percent the size of that screen (mobile,tablet,laptop,desktop etc)

1vh = 1 % of the height of the screen *******
1vw = 1% of the width of the screen **********

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* BACKGROUD IMAGE


The background-image CSS property sets one or more background images on an element.

The background images are drawn on stacking context layers on top of each other.
The first layer specified is drawn as if it is closest to the user.

The borders of the element are then drawn on top of them, and the background-color
is drawn beneath them. How the images are drawn relative to the box and its
borders is defined by the background-clip and background-origin CSS properties.

If a specified image cannot be drawn (for example, when the file denoted by the
specified URI cannot be loaded), browsers handle it as they would a none value.




*BACKGROUND SIZE

The background-size CSS property sets the size of the element's background image.
The image can be left to its natural size, stretched, or constrained to fit the available space.


Values

contain***

Scales the image as large as possible within its container without cropping or
stretching the image. If the container is larger than the image, this will result
in image tiling, unless the background-repeat property is set to no-repeat.

cover***
Scales the image as large as possible to fill the container, stretching
the image if necessary. If the proportions of the image differ from the
element, it is cropped either vertically or horizontally so that no empty
space remains.

auto***
Scales the background image in the corresponding direction such that its
intrinsic proportions are maintained.

<!-- <length>*** -->
Stretches the image in the corresponding dimension to the specified length. Negative values are not allowed.

<!-- <percentage>*** -->
Stretches the image in the corresponding dimension to the specified percentage
of the background positioning area. The background positioning area is determined
by the value of background-origin (by default, the padding box). However, if the
background's background-attachment value is fixed, the positioning area is instead
the entire viewport. Negative values are not allowed.




*BACKGROUND POSITION


The background-position CSS property sets the initial position for each
background image. The position is relative to the position layer set by
background-origin.

* CSS FLEXBOX

BY DEFAULT FLEXBOX IS ALLOWED TO SHRINK ELEMENT TO FIT A CONTAINER

WORKS ONLY IF A CONTAINER HAS CHILD ELEMENTS IN IT

THE PARENT IS CALLED AS A FLEX CONTAINER AND ITS CHILD ELEMENTS ARE CALLED
FLEX ITEMS

FLEXBOX IS ONE DIMENSIONAL LAYOUT METHOD FOR LAYING OUT ITEMS IN ROWS
OR COLUMNS

FLEXBOX ALLOWS US TO DISTRIBUTE SPACE DYNAMICALLY ACROSS ELEMENTS
OF ANA UNKNOWN SIZE,HENCE TERN FLEX

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALIGN-SELF ***

The align-self CSS property overrides a grid or flex item's align-items
value. In Grid, it aligns the item inside the grid area. In Flexbox,
it aligns the item on the cross axis.

The property doesn't apply to block-level boxes, or to table cells.
If a flexbox item's cross-axis margin is auto, then align-self is ignored.

IN .CSS FILE

.el--1 {
align-self: flex-start;
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ORDER ***

The order CSS property sets the order to lay out an item in a
flex or grid container. Items in a container are sorted by ascending
order value and then by their source code order.

IN .CSS file

.el--6 {
order: -1;
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GAP ***

The gap CSS property sets the gaps (gutters) between rows and columns.
It is a shorthand for row-gap and column-gap.

TO CREATE SPACE BETWEEN MARGINS WITHOUT USING MARGIN

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(1) FLEX BASIS

USED TO SIZE FLEX ITEMS, WE DO NOT USE THE WIDTH PROPERTY BUT USE FLEX BASIS

The flex-basis CSS property sets the initial main size of a flex item.
It sets the size of the content box unless otherwise set with box-sizing.


(2) FLEX SHRINK ***

The flex-shrink CSS property sets the flex shrink factor of a flex item.
If the size of all flex items is larger than the flex container, items
shrink to fit according to flex-shrink.

USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER FLEXBOX IS ALLOWED TO SHRINK ELEMENT IF NECESSARY

In use, flex-shrink is used alongside the other flex properties flex-grow
and flex-basis, and normally defined using the flex shorthand.


(3) FLEX GROW ***

The flex-grow CSS property sets the flex grow factor of a flex item's
main size.

REMAINING SPACE IN THE CONTAINER IS EVENLY DIVIDED BETWEEN REMAINING ELEMENTS

IF FLEX GROW SET ON ONE ITEM IN THE CONTAINER, THAT ITEM IS ONLY ALLOWED TO FILL THE REMAINING
SPACE OF THE CONTAINER

if an item1 inside container has flex-grow 1 and item2 has flex-grow 2,
the item2 will occupy double the remaing remaining space of the container
than item1.

(4) FLEX PROPERTY***

This property is a shorthand for the following CSS properties:

flex-grow
flex-shrink
flex-basis
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Justify Content*** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/justify-content

The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes
space between and around content items along the main-axis of a flex
container, and the inline axis of a grid container.

The interactive example below demonstrates some of the values using
Grid Layout.

HELPS UNDERSTAND HOW CONTENT IS DISTRIBUTED ACROSS MAIN AXIS

eg:
justify-content: flex-start
justify-content: flex-end
justify-content: center
justify-content: space-between
justify-content: space-around

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FOR FLEX DIRECTION:ROW;***
--> MAIN AXIS IS X AXIS CONTENT GOES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT
--> CROSS AXIS IS Y AXIS CONTENT GOES FROM TOP TO BOTTOM

FOR FLEX DIRECTION:COLUMN;
--> MAIN AXIS IS Y AXIS CONTENT GOES FROM TOP TO BOTTOM
--> CROSS AXIS IS X AXIS CONTENT GOES FROM LEFT TO RIGHT


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FLEX WRAP***** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap

The flex-wrap CSS property sets whether flex items are forced onto one line or
can wrap onto multiple lines. If wrapping is allowed, it sets the direction
that lines are stacked.

eg,
flex-wrap: wrap;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALIGN ITEMS**** https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/align-items

The CSS align-items property sets the align-self value on all direct children
as a group. In Flexbox, it controls the alignment of items on the Cross Axis.
In Grid Layout, it controls the alignment of items on the Block Axis within
their grid area.

The interactive example below demonstrates some of the values for align-items
using grid layout.

eg,
align-items: flex-start;
align-items: center;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


* MEDIA QUERIES https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media

The @media CSS at-rule can be used to apply part of a style sheet based on the result of one or more media queries. With
it, you
specify a media query and a block of CSS to apply to the document if and only if the media query matches the device on
which the
content is being used.

IN .CSS FILE

@media (width:800px){
h1{
color: purple;
}
}


@media (min-width:800px){ ---> min width 800px and above color purple
h1{
color: purple;
}
}

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* CSS GRID

The grid CSS property is a shorthand property that sets all of the explicit
and implicit grid properties in a single declaration.

Using grid you specify one axis using grid-template-rows or
grid-template-columns, you then specify how content should auto-repeat
in the other axis using the implicit grid properties: grid-auto-rows,
grid-auto-columns, and grid-auto-flow.


Grid-template-columns***

The grid-template-columns CSS property defines the line names and
track sizing functions of the grid columns.


Grid-template-rows***

The grid-template-rows CSS property defines the line names and track sizing
functions of the grid rows.


Column-gap (grid-column-gap)***

The column-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an
element's columns.


Row-gap (grid-row-gap)

The row-gap CSS property sets the size of the gap (gutter) between an
element's grid rows.

Grid-template-rows: 1fr auto;

Auto means that the grid item will take the space it needs and no more than that.


ON GRID CONATINERS**

{
display: grid;
/* grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr auto; */
/* grid-template-rows: 300px 200px; */
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
/* height: 500px; */
/* gap: 30px; */
column-gap: 20px;
row-gap: 40px;
}


ON GRID ITEMS**

.el--8 {
grid-column: 2/3; ---> START/END(2/3) OF COLUMN (START AT LINE 1 END AT LINE 3)
grid-row: 1/2; ---> START/END(1/2) OF ROW (START AT LINE 1 END AT LINE 2)
}


ALIGNING GRID ITEMS AND TRACKS **

ALIGNING TRACKS---
justify-content: center;
/* justify-content: space-between; */

align-content: center;


ALIGNING ITEMS INSIDE CELLS

align-items: end;
justify-items: end;
}

.el--3 {
align-self: center;
justify-self: center;
}
