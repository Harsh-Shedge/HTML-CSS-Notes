USE SHIFT + ALT + F TO FORMAT THE CODE NICELY

*BOLD
<!-- * <b> 'Anything btw this bold tag is bolded, the tage starts as <b>
and ends at </b>'
</b>


* <p> --> Adds line break


<!-- <p> HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text
        separated from adjacent blocks
        by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related
        content,
        such as images or form fields.
        Paragraphs are block-level elements, and notably will automatically close if another block-level element is
        parsed before the closing </p> -->



* HEADINGS

<!-- h1 should be used for the top level main heading, one at most

<h1>Heading level 1</h1> Size of the text btw heading is in decreasing order
<h2>Heading level 2</h2> Depends if you use h1 or h2 or h3 or h4 or h5 or h6
<h3>Heading level 3</h3>
<h4>Heading level 4</h4>
<h5>Heading level 5</h5>
<h6>Heading level 6</h6> -->

*DOCTYPE
<!-- <!DOCTYPE html> # Does not have a closing tag, just says that we are using HTML 5

* The <html> HTML element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document,
so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element.
Permitted content -->
<!-- ONE  <head> element (contains things that dont show up on page) -->
<!-- followed by one --> -->
<!-- <body> element. -->


*
<!-- The <head> HTML element contains machine-readable information (metadata) about the document, like its title,scripts, and style sheets. -->
--> -->

*TITLE
<!-- The <title> (WORDS WE SEE ON TABS,NOT THE ACTUAL TITLE OF PAGE) HTML element defines the document's 
title that is shown in a browser's title bar or a page's tab. 
It only contains text; tags within the element are ignored. -->
<!-- (DOES NOT SHOW UP ANYWHERE IN PAGE ONLY IN BROWSER) -->

*
<!-- The <body> HTML element represents the contents of an HTML document. There can be only one <body> element in a document. -->


* LIST ELEMENTS

<!-- The <ol> HTML element represents an ordered list of items — typically rendered as a numbered list. -->
<!-- Permitted content for <ol></ol> --- > 	Zero or more <li>, <script> and <template> elements. -->

<!-- The <ul> HTML element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list. -->
<!-- Permitted content for <ul></ul> --- > 	Zero or more <li>, <script> and <template> elements. -->


<!-- The <li> (list items) HTML element is used to represent an item in a list. It must be contained in a parent 
element: an ordered list (ol), an unordered list (ul), or a menu (menu). In menus and 
unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, 
they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter. -->
<!-- <li></li> represents a single item in a list -->

WE CAN ALSO CREATE NESTED LISTS

* THE ANCHOR ELEMENT
<!-- <a>: THE ANCHOR ELEMENT -->

<!-- The <a> HTML element (or anchor element), with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, 
locations in the same page, or anything else a URL can address.

Content within each <a> should indicate the link's destination. If the href attribute 
is present, pressing the enter key while focused on the <a> element will activate it. -->

EXAMPLE

<!-- <p>You can reach Michael at:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://example.com">Website</a></li>
  <li><a href="mailto:m.bluth@example.com">Email</a></li>
  <li><a href="tel:+123456789">Phone</a></li>
</ul> -->

IN ORDER TO TELL HTML THAT WE WANT THE LINK INSIDE THE ANCHOR TAG TO OPEN A Website
WE TYPE 'http://www' BEFORE THE ACTUAL LINK
EXAMPLE : http://www.google.com

We can also link to other html document that we have created!!
FOR EXAMPLE IF WE CREATE A ABOUT.HTML FILE, WE CAN TYPE IN THE
ANCHOR TAG AS "ABOUT.HTML"

<!-- <a href="chickens.html">Go to chickens</a>
<a href="http://www.google.com">I am a link to google</a>
<a href="about.html">About page</a> -->


* THE IMAGE EMBEDDED ELEMENT
<!-- <img> 
The <img> HTML element embeds an image into the document.

<img class="fit-picture"
src="/media/cc0-images/grapefruit-slice-332-332.jpg"
alt="Grapefruit slice atop a pile of other slices"> -->

<!-- The src(SOURCE) attribute is required, and contains the path to the image you want to embed.

The alt attribute holds a text description of the image, which isn't mandatory but is 
incredibly useful for accessibility — screen readers read this description out to their 
users so they know what the image means. Alt text is also displayed on the page if the 
image can't be loaded for some reason: for example, network errors, content blocking, 
or linkrot. -->

YOU CAN USE HTML TO ADJUST SIZE OF PHOTO USING 'width' element followed by the
'size' and 'px'--> pixels, HOWEVER IT IS A BAD PRACTISE, USE CSS INSTEAD


* INLINE ELEMENTS

Inline elements fit in alongside other elements, example : anchor tags,span,time

* BLOCK ELEMENTS

Block level elements take up a whole 'block' of space,example : paragraphs,div



* THE CONTENT DIVISION ELEMENT
<!-- <div> -->

<!-- The <div> HTML element is the generic container for flow content. 
It has no effect on the content or layout until styled in some way 
using CSS (e.g. styling is directly applied to it, or some kind of 
layout model like Flexbox is applied to its parent element). -->


<!-- Permitted content	Flow content.
Or (in WHATWG HTML): If the parent is a <dl> element: 
one or more <dt> elements followed by one or more <dd> 
elements, optionally intermixed with <script> and 
<template> elements. -->


* THE CONTENT SPAN ELEMENT

<!-- <span>: The Content Span element -->

<!-- The <span> HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing 
content, which does not inherently represent anything. It can be 
used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or id 
attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as lang. 
It should be used only when no other semantic element is appropriate. 
<span> is very much like a <div> element, but <div> is a block-level 
element whereas a <span> is an inline element. -->

Permitted content Phrasing content.


* HORIZONTAL RULE ELEMENT

<!-- <hr>: The Thematic Break (Horizontal Rule) element -->

<!-- The <hr> HTML element represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements: 
for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic within a section. -->


*LINE BREAK ELEMENT

<!-- The <br> HTML element produces a line break in text (carriage-return). 
It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant. -->

<!-- Note: Do not use <br> to create margins between paragraphs; wrap them in <p> 
elements and use the CSS margin property to control their size. -->


* THE SUPER SCRIPT ELEMENT

<!-- The <sup> HTML element specifies inline text which is to be displayed as 
superscript for solely typographical reasons. Superscripts are usually 
rendered with a raised baseline using smaller text. -->

Permitted content Phrasing content.


* THE SUBSCRIPT ELEMENT

<!-- The <sub> HTML element specifies inline text which should be displayed as 
subscript for solely typographical reasons. Subscripts are typically 
rendered with a lowered baseline using smaller text. -->

Permitted content Phrasing content.


* HTML ENTITIES

Starts with an amperstand(&) and ends with a semicolon(;) with a specific txt in btw to display that character/symbol

Used to display reserved characters that normally would be invalid

Also used in place of difficult to type characters

The browser intreprets them and renders the correct character instead.


* INTRO TO SEMANTIC MARKUP

Semantic - relating to meaning

INSTEAD OF DIVS USE MORE SPECIFIC ELEMENTS LIKE

<!-- <section> -->
<!-- <article> -->
<!-- <nav> -->
<!-- <main> -->
<!-- <header> -->
<!-- <footer> -->
<!-- <assign> -->
<!-- <summary> -->
<!-- <details> -->


<!-- (1)  <main> -->

<!-- The <main> HTML element represents the dominant content of the <body> of 
a document. The main content area consists of content that is directly 
related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the 
central functionality of an application. -->

Permitted content Flow content.

<!-- The content of a <main> element should be unique to the document. Content that is repeated across a set of documents or
document sections such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms shouldn't be
included unless the search form is the main function of the page. -->

USAGE NOTES
<!-- <main> doesn't contribute to the document's outline; that is, unlike elements such as
<body>, headings such as <h2>, and such, <main> doesn't affect the DOM's concept of the structure of the page. It's
strictly informative. -->


* THE NAVIGATION SECTION ELEMENT
<!-- <nav>: The Navigation Section element -->

<!-- The <nav> HTML element represents a section of a page whose purpose is to 
provide navigation links, either within the current document or to other 
documents. Common examples of navigation sections are menus, tables of 
contents, and indexes. -->

Permitted content Flow content.

<!-- Flow content is a broad category that encompasses most elements that can go inside the <body> element, 
including heading elements, sectioning elements, phrasing elements, embedding elements, interactive elements, 
and form-related elements. It also includes text nodes (but not those that only consist of white space characters). -->

<!-- The flow elements are: <a>, <abbr>, <address>, <article>, <aside>, <audio>, <b>,<bdo>, <bdi>, <blockquote>, 
<br>, <button>, <canvas>, <cite>, <code>, <command>, <data>, <datalist>, <del>, <details>, <dfn>, <div>, <dl>, 
<em>, <embed>, <fieldset>, <figure>, <footer>, <form>, <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <header>, <hgroup>, 
<hr>, <i>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <ins>, <kbd>, <keygen>, <label>, <main>, <map>, <mark>, <math>, <menu>, 
<meter>, <nav>, <noscript>, <object>, <ol>, <output>, <p>, <picture>, <pre>, <progress>, <q>, <ruby>, <s>, 
<samp>, <script>, <section>, <select>, <small>, <span>, <strong>, <sub>, <sup>, <svg>, <table>, <template>, 
<textarea>, <time>, <u>, <ul>, <var>, <video>, and <wbr>.
  
A few other elements belong to this category, but only if a specific condition is fulfilled:
  
<area>, if it is a descendant of a <map> element
<link>, if the itemprop attribute is present
<meta>, if the itemprop attribute is present
<style>, if the scoped attribute is present -->


* THE GENERIC SECTION ELEMENT
<!-- <section>: The Generic Section element -->

<!-- The <section> HTML element represents a generic standalone section 
of a document, which doesn't have a more specific semantic element 
to represent it. Sections should always have a heading, with very 
few exceptions. -->


* THE ARTICLE CONTENTS ELEMENT

<!-- The <article> HTML element represents a self-contained composition in a document, 
page, application, or site, which is intended to be independently distributable or 
reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples include: a forum post, a magazine or 
newspaper article, or a blog entry, a product card, a user-submitted comment, 
an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content. -->

Permitted content Flow content.

Usage NOTES

<!-- Each <article> should be identified, typically by including a heading (<h1>-<h6> element) as a child of the <article> element.
When an <article> element is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element. For example, the comments of a 
blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article> representing the blog post.
Author information of an <article> element can be provided through the <address> element, but it doesn't apply to nested <article> elements.
he publication date and time of an <article> element can be described using the datetime attribute of a <time> element.
Note that the pubdate attribute of <time> is no longer a part of the W3C HTML5 standard. -->


*THE ASIDE ELEMENT

<!-- The <aside> HTML element represents a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly 
related to the document's main content. Asides are frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes. -->

Permitted content Flow content.


*HEADER
<!-- <header> -->

<!-- The <header> HTML element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or 
navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also a logo, a search form, an author name, and other elements.
-->

<!-- Permitted content	Flow content, but with no <header> or <footer> descendant. -->


* FOOTER

<!-- The <footer> HTML element represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content 
or sectioning root element. A <footer> typically contains information about the 
author of the section, copyright data or links to related documents. -->


* DATE TIME ELEMENT

<!-- The <time> HTML element represents a specific period in time. It may include 
the datetime attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format, allowing 
for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders. -->


<!-- <p>The Cure will be celebrating their 40th anniversary on 
<time datetime="2018-07-07">July 7</time> in London's Hyde Park.</p> -->


* THE FIGURE WITH OPTIONAL CAPTION

<!-- The <figure> HTML element represents self-contained content, potentially with an 
optional caption, which is specified using the <figcaption> element. The figure, its 
caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit. -->

<!-- Permitted content	A <figcaption> element, followed by flow content; 
or flow content followed by a <figcaption> element; or flow content. -->

USAGE NOTES

<!-- Usually a <figure> is an image, illustration, diagram, code snippet, etc., that is referenced in the main flow of a document, 
but that can be moved to another part of the document or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.

Being a sectioning root, the outline of the content of the <figure> element is excluded from the main outline of the document.

A caption can be associated with the <figure> element by inserting a <figcaption> inside it (as the first or 
the last child). The first <figcaption> element found in the figure is presented as the figure's caption. -->



* HTML TABLES

<!-- Tables are structured set of data,made of rows and columns.They can be
a great way of displaying data clearly  -->

<!-- <table>, <td>,<tr>,<th>,<thead>,<tbody>,<tfoot>,<coolgroup>,<caption> -->


* THE TABLE ELEMENT

<!-- The <table> HTML element represents tabular data — that is, information 
presented in a two-dimensional table comprised of rows and columns of cells containing data. -->

<!-- Permitted content	In this order:

an optional <caption> element,

zero or more <colgroup> elements,

an optional <thead> element,

either one of the following:

zero or more <tbody> elements

one or more <tr> elements

an optional <tfoot> element -->


* TABLE DATA CELL ELEMENT

<!-- The <td> HTML element defines a cell of a table that contains data. It participates in the 
table model. -->


* TABLE ROW ELEMENT

<!-- The <tr> HTML element defines a row of cells in a table. The row's cells can 
then be established using a mix of <td> (data cell) and <th> (header cell) elements. -->

* TABLE HEADER ELEMENT

<!-- The <th> HTML element defines a cell as header of a group of table cells. The 
exact nature of this group is defined by the scope and headers attributes. -->

Permitted content Flow content, but with no header, footer, sectioning content, or heading content descendants.


* TABLE HEAD ELEMENT

<!-- The <thead> HTML element defines a set of rows defining the head of the columns of the table. -->

<!-- Permitted content	Zero or more <tr> elements. -->


* TABLE BODY ELEMENT

<!-- The <tbody> HTML element encapsulates a set of table rows (<tr> elements), indicating that they comprise the body of the table (<table>). -->

<!-- Permitted content	Zero or more <tr> elements. -->


* FORM ELEMENT

<!-- The <form> element itself is a shell or a container that itself doesn't have any visual impact -->
<!-- We then fill the form with collection of inputs, check boxes,buttons etc -->

<!-- Form element "represents document section containing interactive controls for submitting information -->

<!-- <form action=""></form> --> (Example)

<!-- Action attribute specifies WHERE the form data should be sent -->
<!-- The method attribute specifies which http method should be used-->


* WHAT GOES INSIDE FORM ELEMENT

<!-- (1) <input> -->

Used to create variety of different form controls

20+ possible types of inputs ranging from date pickers to check boxes.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input (Input Types link)

Type attribute is where the magic happens.Chnaging type dramatically alters
inputs behaviour and appereance.

Place holder is an attribute that will specify the space holder text for an input
which is the text that text that shows up before we type anything

<!-- <input type="text" placeholder="username"> --> Example


* INPUT LABEL ELEMENT

<!-- The <label> HTML element represents a caption for an item in a user interface. -->


<!-- Associating a <label> with an <input> element offers some major advantages:

The label text is not only visually associated with its corresponding text input; it is programmatically associated
with it too. This means that, for example, a screen reader will read out the label when the user is focused on the
form input, making it easier for an assistive technology user to understand what data should be entered.


When a user clicks or touches/taps a label, the browser passes the focus to its associated input (the resulting event
is also raised for the input). That increased hit area for focusing the input provides an advantage to anyone trying
to activate it — including those using a touch-screen device.
To associate the <label> with an <input> element, you need to give the <input> an id attribute. The <label> then needs
a for attribute whose value is the same as the input's id.


Alternatively, you can nest the <input> directly inside the <label>, in which case the for and id attributes are
not needed because the association is implicit: -->

ATTRIBUTES FOR LABEL AND INPUT

<!-- Attributes
This element includes the global attributes.

for attribute

The value of the for attribute must be a single id for a labelable form-related element in the same document as the <label> element. 
So, any given label element can be associated with only one form control.

The first element in the document with an id attribute matching the value of the for attribute is the labeled 
control for this label element — if the element with that id is actually a labelable element. If it is not a 
labelable element, then the for attribute has no effect. If there are other elements that also match the id value, 
later in the document, they are not considered.

Multiple label elements can be given the same value for their for attribute; doing so causes the associated form control 
(the form control that for value references) to have multiple labels. -->

EXAMPLE
<!-- <label for="username">Enter user name</label>

<input id="username" type="text" placeholder="username"> -->


* BUTTON ELEMENT

<!-- The <button> HTML element represents a clickable button, used to submit forms or anywhere in a document for accessible, standard button functionality.

By default, HTML buttons are presented in a style resembling the platform the user agent runs on, but you can change buttons’ appearance with CSS. -->

Permitted content Phrasing content but there must be no Interactive content

If button inside the form element, default behaviour is to submit the form

If you want a button inside form to not submit change its type to BUTTON, the default type is SUBMIT
<!-- <button type="button">Please do not submit</button> -->

<!-- YOU CAN ALSO USE <input type="Submit" value="Click Me">  --> NOT RECOMMENDED

NAME attribute IS IMPORTANT FOR EVERY INPUT USED!!

https://www.google.com/search?q=pizza
<!--the name attribute point towards the search name can be, different for different servers here is 'q' search term-->

<!-- <form action="https://www.reddit.com/search">
  <input type="text" name="q">
  <button>Search Reddit</button>
</form> -->

EVEN IF YOU DONT HAVE A BUTTON FOR A FORM AND JUST THE INPUT, FORM WILL STILL BE SUBMITTED


<!-- <input type="checkbox"> --> checkbox attribute

<!-- <input> elements of type checkbox are rendered by default as boxes that are checked 
(ticked) when activated, like you might see in an official government paper form. The exact 
appearance depends upon the operating system configuration under which the browser is running. 
Generally this is a square but it may have rounded corners. A checkbox allows you to select single 
values for submission in a form (or not). -->


<!-- <input type="radio"> --> radio attribute

<!-- <input> elements of type radio are generally used in radio groups—collections of radio buttons describing a set of related options.

Only one radio button in a given group can be selected at the same time. Radio buttons are typically rendered as small circles, 
which are filled or highlighted when selected. -->

Defining a radio group
A radio group is defined by giving each of radio buttons in the group the same name. Once a radio group is established,
selecting any radio button in that group automatically deselects any currently-selected radio button in the same group.

You can have as many radio groups on a page as you like, as long as each has its own unique name.

EXAMPLE

<!-- <label for="xs">XS</label>
<input type="radio" name="size" id="xs" value="xs">
<label for="s">S</label>
<input type="radio" name="size" id="s" value="s">
<label for="l">L</label>
<input type="radio" name="size" id="l" value="l"> -->

INORDER TO KNOW WHICH RADIO WAS SELECTED WE ADD THE VALUE ATTRIBUTE INSIDE THE INPUT TAG

file:///C:/birds?size=s



* HTML SELECT ELEMENT

<!-- The <select> HTML element represents a control that provides a menu of options: -->

EXAMPLE
<!-- <label for="pet-select">Choose a pet:</label>

  <select name="pets" id="pet-select">
      <option value="">--Please choose an option--</option>
      <option value="dog">Dog</option>
      <option value="cat">Cat</option>
      <option value="hamster">Hamster</option>
      <option value="parrot">Parrot</option>
      <option value="spider">Spider</option>
      <option value="goldfish">Goldfish</option>
  </select> -->


<!-- The above example shows typical <select> usage. It is given an id attribute to enable it to be associated with a <label> for accessibility 
purposes, as well as a name attribute to represent the name of the associated data point submitted to the server. Each menu option is defined by 
an <option> element nested inside the <select>.

Each <option> element should have a value attribute containing the data value to submit to the server when that option is selected. 
If no value attribute is included, the value defaults to the text contained inside the element. You can include a selected attribute 
on an <option> element to make it selected by default when the page first loads.
    
The <select> element has some unique attributes you can use to control it, such as multiple to specify whether multiple options can 
be selected, and size to specify how many options should be shown at once. It also accepts most of the general form input attributes 
such as required, disabled, autofocus, etc. -->


* HTML OPTION ELEMENT

<!-- The <option> HTML element is used to define an item contained in a <select>, an <optgroup>, 
or a <datalist> element. As such, <option> can represent menu items in popups and other lists of 
items in an HTML document. -->

<!-- Permitted content	Text, possibly with escaped characters (like &eacute;). -->

Value Attribute
The content of this attribute represents the value to be submitted with the form, should this
option be selected. If this attribute is omitted, the value is taken from the text content of the option element.
<!-- 
<option value="veg">Veg</option>
<option value="steak">Steak</option> -->

Selected attribute

<!-- If present, this Boolean attribute indicates that the option is initially selected. 
If the <option> element is the descendant of a <select> element whose multiple attribute is not 
set, only one single <option> of this <select> element may have the selected attribute. -->

<!-- <option value="veg" selected>Veg</option> -->



* RANGE ATTRIBUTE FOR INPUT

<!-- <input> elements of type range let the user specify a numeric value which must be no less than 
a given value, and no more than another given value. The precise value, however, is not considered 
important. This is typically represented using a slider or dial control rather than a text entry box like the number input type. -->

Validation
There is no pattern validation available; however, the following forms of automatic validation are performed:

If the value is set to something which can't be converted into a valid floating-point number, validation fails because
the input is suffering from a bad input.
The value won't be less than min. The default is 0.
The value won't be greater than max. The default is 100.
The value will be a multiple of step. The default is 1.

Value

The value attribute contains a DOMString which contains a string representation of
the selected number. The value is never an empty string (""). The default value is halfway
between the specified minimum and maximum—unless the maximum is actually less than the minimum,
in which case the default is set to the value of the min attribute.

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range FOR MORE ATTRIBUTES IN RANGE

<!-- <label for="cheese">Cheese amount</label> -->
<!-- <input type="range" name="cheese lvl" value="5" id="cheese" min="1" max="10"> -->



* TEXT AREA ELEMENT

<!-- The <textarea> HTML element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control, 
useful when you want to allow users to enter a sizeable amount of free-form text, for example a comment on a review or feedback form. -->


<!-- <label for="story">Tell us your story:</label>

<textarea id="story" name="story"
          rows="5" cols="33">
It was a dark and stormy night...
</textarea> -->


<!-- An id attribute to allow the <textarea> to be associated with a <label> element for accessibility purposes

A name attribute to set the name of the associated data point submitted to the server when the form is submitted.

rows and cols attributes to allow you to specify an exact size for the <textarea> to take. Setting these is a good idea for consistency, as browser defaults can differ.

Default content entered between the opening and closing tags. <textarea> does not support the value attribute.

The <textarea> element also accepts several attributes common to form <input>s, such as autocomplete, autofocus, disabled, placeholder, readonly, and required. -->


* HTML ATTRIBUTE REQUIRED

<!-- The Boolean required attribute, if present, indicates that the user must specify a value for the input before the owning form can be submitted.

The required attribute is supported by text, search, url, tel, email, password, date, month, week, time, datetime-local, number, checkbox, 
radio, file, <input> types along with the <select> and <textarea> form control elements. If present on any of these input types and elements, 
the :required pseudo class will match. If the attribute is not included, the :optional pseudo class will match. -->
